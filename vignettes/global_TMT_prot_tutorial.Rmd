# Introduction

FragPipeAnalystR is a R package intended for FragPipe downstream analysis. We also make it compatible with the result obtained from FragPipe-Analyst. Users are able to reproduce and customize the plots generated in FragPipe-Analyst.

## Quick Start Example
``` {r include=T, warning=F}
library(FragPipeAnalystR)
ccrcc <- make_se_from_files("/Users/hsiaoyi/Documents/workspace/FragPipeR_manuscript/data/TMT_4plex/abundance_protein_MD.tsv",
                         "/Users/hsiaoyi/Documents/workspace/FragPipeR_manuscript/data/TMT_4plex/experiment_annotation_clean.tsv",
                         type = "TMT", level = "protein")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_pca(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_correlation_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_missval_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature_numbers(ccrcc)
```

You may want to check some of known markers through box plots:

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature(ccrcc,  c("Q16790", # CA9
                      "Q8IVF2", # AHNAK2
                      "P19404", # NDUFV2
                      "P01833" # PIGR
                      ))
```

This could be done via `Gene` column as well:

```{r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature(ccrcc, c("CA9", "AHNAK2", "NDUFV2", "PIGR"), index="Gene")
```

```{r include=T, warning=F}
de_result <- test_limma(ccrcc, type = "all")
de_result_updated <- add_rejections(de_result)
```

Volcano plot is designed for visualizing differential expression analysis result:

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_volcano(de_result_updated, "Tumor_vs_NAT")
```

It could be labelled by different column available in the `rowData(de_result_updated)` such as `Gene`:

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_volcano(de_result_updated, "Tumor_vs_NAT", name_col="Gene")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
or_result <- or_test(de_result_updated, database = "Hallmark", direction = "UP")
plot_or(or_result)
```

```{r include=T, warning=F}
or_result <- or_test(de_result_updated, database = "Hallmark", direction = "DOWN")
plot_or(or_result)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
sessionInfo()
```
