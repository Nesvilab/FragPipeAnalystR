# Introduction

FragPipeAnalystR is a R package intended for FragPipe downstream analysis. We also make it compatible with the result obtained from FragPipe-Analyst. Users are able to reproduce and customize the plots generated in FragPipe-Analyst.

## CCRCC DIA data

As described in the manuscript, DIA ccRCC data were fetched from [Clark et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.007) and processed via [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/). As you will see in the following sections. The result is quite similar to corresponding TMT data.
``` {r include=T, warning=F}
library(FragPipeAnalystR)
ccrcc <- make_se_from_files("/Users/hsiaoyi/Documents/workspace/FragPipeR_manuscript/data/DIA_4plex/diann-output.pg_matrix.tsv",
                         "/Users/hsiaoyi/Documents/workspace/FragPipeR_manuscript/data/DIA_4plex/experiment_annotation_clean.tsv",
                         type = "DIA")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_pca(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_correlation_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_missval_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature_numbers(ccrcc)
```

```{r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature(ccrcc, c("CA9", "AHNAK2", "NDUFV2", "PIGR"))
```

```{r include=T, warning=F}
de_result <- test_limma(ccrcc, type = "all")
de_result_updated <- add_rejections(de_result)
plot_volcano(de_result_updated, "Tumor_vs_NAT")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
sessionInfo()
```
